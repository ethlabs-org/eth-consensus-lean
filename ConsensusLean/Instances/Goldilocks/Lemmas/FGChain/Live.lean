/-! # Goldilocks FG: step facts for liveness

Two facts of one accepted block that the liveness argument uses (workbench
`fg-liveness/r14-end-to-end`, s5 lemma T and s6 L6.1):
* a block that enters a new height without justifying the old one (a timeout) has a slot at
  least `δt` after the entry of the old height;
* a block that justifies a bound height has finalized its predecessor: the loose-BJ gate reads
  the finalization of the same block. -/

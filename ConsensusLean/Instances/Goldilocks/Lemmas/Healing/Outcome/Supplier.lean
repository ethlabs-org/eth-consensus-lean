/-! # Goldilocks Healing: the post-reset duty supplier (run level)

The objects of fradamt-agent/workbench `producer-reset-continuation.md` §22–§23 and
`phase-service.md` §10 (HS.2) after the reset `a = a_z`, stated over the run, for every consumer
(C1.2 here, H.3 (c)'s `reset_inv` through workbench#21), not specialized to C1.2's entries.
With `b = slot(a) + 3` (`cleanLabel`) and `R = t_{b+2k+2}` (`drainTime`, the `R_z` of C1.2):

* **RN, stored ancestry is irreversible** (§22): every lock stored at a later cut sits below a
  stored lock of its slot at an earlier cut, or below a fresh write between them
  (`stored_lock_below`, `SA.lock_provenance_from` on the AC projection). **RU** (§22) is
  `SA.unlock_compatible`: unlocking against a view with at least `n/2` validators whose slot-`s`
  support votes extend `B`, or that equivocate, moves every lock of a slot below `s` to a block
  compatible with `B`.
* **The drain** (§23, HS.2 (3)): from `R` on, every live lock has a label at least `b + k + 2`, so
  every lock with a label before `b` or a slow window straddling `b` has expired
  (`drain_live_locks`).
* **Clean fast transfer** (`clean_fast_transfer`, HS.2 (1)): the stored block of a fast lock of
  label `≥ b` written by an honest joined node is extended by every honest vote of a later slot,
  and is in the voter's viable voter block tree or at or below its `fc_root` there (HR.4 (R3)
  when it is high; inherited from a high seed when it is a low ancestor of one).
* **Clean slow transfer** (`clean_slow_transfer`, phase-service §10, HS.2 (2)): the raw slow
  selection `S` of an honest update of label `j` (`SA.SlowLockAt`) whose slow window is clean
  (`b + k − 1 ≤ j`) is extended by every honest vote of a later slot, and is in the voter's
  viable voter block tree or at or below its `fc_root` there.
* **The joined duty at honest ready proposals** (§23 "Joined duty conclusion", phase-service §10
  "Join with RN/RU"): for an honest ready proposal `P` of slot `u` with `t_u ≥ R`, every honest
  slot-`u` vote is `P` (`ready_unanimous`), and at every honest update of slot `u` (at
  `t_u + 6Δ`) the result is `P`, not vetoed, with fast selection `P`, and the FG source the tick
  returns extends `P`; or an honest accepted block has justified `P`'s entry by then
  (`ready_update`).

Interfaces: every theorem but `stored_lock_below` and `drain_live_locks` is open; their paper
proofs are workbench#6 §22–§23 and #7 §10, conditional on HR.4. -/
